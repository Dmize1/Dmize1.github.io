<p>This is it! I finally got the bugs worked out and created the site.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">FINALLY</h2>

<p>It took me a good coulple of hours to get this site set up but now that I have I can customize it to my likings. I changed each of the banner images to be destiny related because the concept art is prettier than the finished product. I also like to play Destiny a lot with my friends.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Learning the code</h2>

<p> I started setting up the repository for this site this morning and continued to improve upon it throughout the day. The most frustrating part was testing my changes to the website due to my lack of knowledge with local hosting, but I was able to overcome that obstacle and make changes to the site. The part that took the longest was probably learning how to put images into the middle of the page like so.</p>

<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/img1.jpg" alt="Hunter Titan and Warlock">
</a>
<span class="caption text-muted">I like to play Destiny.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">Summary of changes</h2>

<p>Changed _config.yml file to have my personal settings.</p>

<p>Changed tag to "Internship Blog"</p>

<p>Changed banners on Home, Contact and About pages to be Destiny related.</p>

<p>Updated Home, Contact, and About pages to have my own writing on them.</p>
